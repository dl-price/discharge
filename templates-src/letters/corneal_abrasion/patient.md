# Corneal Abrasion (Scratch to the Eye)

## What is a corneal abrasion?
You were seen in the Emergency Department today and diagnosed with a **corneal abrasion**, which is a scratch on the clear surface at the front of the eye (the cornea).

This is a common injury and usually heals well within a few days. However, because the cornea is very sensitive, it can be painful while it heals and needs careful treatment to prevent infection.

## What to expect
- Pain, irritation, or a gritty feeling in the eye
- Sensitivity to light
- Watering of the eye
- Blurred vision (usually temporary)

Symptoms should steadily improve over **24–72 hours**.

## Looking after your eye at home
- **Do not rub your eye**
{{#if contact_lens_advice_given}}- Avoid contact lenses until advised it is safe to restart them
{{/if}}
- Wear sunglasses if light bothers your eye
- Avoid dusty or windy environments if possible

## When to seek urgent medical help
**Return to the Emergency Department if you have:**
- Very bad eye pain
- Worsening or sudden loss of vision

**See your GP for advice if you have:**
- A fever over 38C or higher, or chills
- You still have pain in your eye or are bothered by bright lights after 1 to 2 days
- You have signs of an eye infection like swelling, redness, warmth, pain, or drainage from the eye
- You have new or worsening symptoms

If symptoms remain limited to the eye it is probably best to see an optometrist instead.

If you are concerned at any time, it is safest to seek medical review.
