# Emergency Department Discharge Advice
## Pneumonia (Chest Infection)

### Why you came to the Emergency Department
You were seen in the Emergency Department because you were diagnosed with **pneumonia**, also known as a chest infection. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue, most commonly caused by bacteria or viruses. It can cause symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue.

Based on your assessment today (including your symptoms, observations, and any tests performed), it is safe for you to continue your recovery **at home**.

### Looking after yourself at home
Recovery from pneumonia can take **several weeks**, even after treatment has started. It is normal to feel tired during this time.

Please follow this advice:

- **Rest regularly**, but try gentle activity (such as short walks) as you start to feel better.
- **Drink plenty of fluids** to avoid dehydration.
- Eat small, nutritious meals if your appetite is reduced.
- Avoid smoking or vaping.
- Avoid alcohol while unwell and while taking antibiotics.
- Gradually return to normal activities as your energy improves.
