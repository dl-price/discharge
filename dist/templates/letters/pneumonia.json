It is normal to feel tired during this time.\n\nPlease follow this advice:\n\n- **Rest regularly**, but try gentle activity (such as short walks) as you start to feel better.\n- **Drink plenty of fluids** to avoid dehydration.\n- Eat small, nutritious meals if your appetite is reduced.\n- Avoid smoking or vaping.\n- Avoid alcohol while unwell and while taking antibiotics.\n- Gradually return to normal activities as your energy improves.\n\n---\n\n{{#if antibiotics}}\n### Antibiotics\n- Take your **antibiotics exactly as prescribed**.\n{{#bullets antibiotics indent=2}}\n- It is important to **complete the full course**, even if you start to feel better.\n{{/if}}\n\n### Medications\n- You may take **paracetamol** for fever, aches, or chest discomfort.\n{{#bullets other_meds}}\n- Use other medications only as advised by your doctor.\n\n---\n\n### Cough and breathing\n- A cough is common and helps clear infection from your lungs.\n\n---\n\n### Follow-up\n{{#if see_gp}}\n- See your **GP** within **{{see_gp}}** to check your recovery.\n{{/if}}\n- If you do not feel back to your baseline within several weeks you should see your GP to see if there is something else going on\n{{#if repeat_xr}}\n- You may need a repeat chest X-ray in {{repeat_xr}} — your GP will arrange this if required.\n{{/if}}\n{{#if chase_xr_report}}\n- Your x ray has been reviewed by a doctor but not formally reported by a radiologist. You will be contacted if there are any further concerns or follow up required based on the formal report.\n{{/if}}\n{{#bullets other_fu}}\n\n---\n\n### Worsening advice\nWhile it is safe for you continue treatment at home, sometimes things will get worse despite treatment.\n\n#### Call **000** immediately if you develop:\n- Severe difficulty breathing or you are struggling to speak in full sentences\n- Blue or grey lips or fingertips\n- Sudden collapse or loss of consciousness\n- Severe chest pain not relieved by rest\n- Confusion or marked drowsiness\n\n#### Return to the Emergency Department urgently if you have:\n- Worsening shortness of breath\n- Fever that is not improving after **48 hours** of treatment\n- Shaking chills or rigors\n- Coughing up increasing amounts of sputum, especially if bloody\n- Increasing chest pain\n- Vomiting or inability to keep fluids or medications down\n- You feel generally worse rather than better\n- Any new or concerning symptoms\n\n---\n\n{{disclaimer}}",
